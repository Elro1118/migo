# MIGO!

When immigrants arrived in the United States, most of them only have money to pay their bills and food. However, most immigrants who do not speak English want to learn it.

Many people may think that immigrants can find free English classes online like Dulingo, fluentu, etc. However, speaking is a skill that has to be developed through personal interaction.

MIGO! will help immigrants find places where immigrants can learn English for free.
