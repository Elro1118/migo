# MIGO!

When immigrants arrive to the United States, most of them only have money to pay their bills and food. However, most immigrants who do not speak English want to learn how to.

Many people may think that immigrants can find free English classes online like Dulingo, fluentu, etc. However, speaking is a skill that has to be developed through personal interaction.

MIGO! will help them find places where they can learn English for free.
